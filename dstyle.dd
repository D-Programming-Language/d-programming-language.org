$(D_S The D Style,

$(P
    $(I The D Style) is a set of style conventions for writing
    D programs. The D Style is not enforced by the compiler. It is
    purely cosmetic and a matter of choice. Adhering to the D Style,
    however, will make it easier for others to work with your
    code and easier for you to work with others' code.
    The D Style can form the starting point for a project
    style guide customized for your project team.
)

$(P
    Submissions to Phobos and other official D source code will
    follow these guidelines.

<h3>Whitespace</h3>

$(UL
    $(LI One statement per line.)

    $(LI Use spaces instead of hardware tabs.)

    $(LI Each indentation level will be four columns.)
)

<h3>Comments</h3>

$(UL
    $(LI Use // comments to document a single line:
-------------------------------
statement;  // comment
statement;  // comment
-------------------------------
    )

    $(LI Use block comments to document a multiple line block of
    statements:
-------------------------------
/* comment
 * comment
 */
 statement;
 statement;
-------------------------------
    )

    $(LI Use $(CODE version (none)) to $(SINGLEQUOTE comment out) a piece of trial code
    that is syntactically valid:
-------------------------------
  version (none)
  {
    /* comment
     * comment
     */
     statement;
     statement;
  }
-------------------------------

    It can be turned on with $(CODE version(all)):

-------------------------------
  version (all)
  {
    /* comment
     * comment
     */
     statement;
     statement;
  }
-------------------------------

    )

    $(LI Use nesting comments to $(SINGLEQUOTE comment out) a piece of syntactically invalid code:
-------------------------------
/+++++
    /* comment
     * comment
     */
     { statement;
       statement;
 +++++/
-------------------------------
    )
)

<h3>Naming Conventions</h3>

$(DL
    $(DT General)
    $(DD Unless listed otherwise below, names should be camelCased (this
         includes $(I all) variables). So, names formed by joining multiple
         words have each word other than the first word capitalized. Also, names
         do not begin with an underscore $(SINGLEQUOTE _) unless they are
         private.

-------------------------------
int myFunc();
string myLocalVar;
-------------------------------
    )

    $(DT Modules)
    $(DD Module and package names should be all lowercase, and only contain
         the characters [a..z][0..9][_]. This avoids problems when dealing with
         case-insensitive file systems.
-------------------------------
import std.algorithm;
-------------------------------
    )

$(V1
    $(DT C Modules)
    $(DD Modules that are interfaces to C functions go into the "c"
    package, for example:
-------------------------------
import std.c.stdio;
-------------------------------
    Module names should be all lower case.
    )
)

    $(DT Classes, Structs, Unions, Enums, Templates)
    $(DD The names of user-defined types should be PascalCased, which is the
         same as camelCased except that the first letter is uppercase.

-------------------------------
class Foo;
struct FooAndBar;
-------------------------------
    )

    $(DD An exception is that eponymous templates that return a value instead of
         a type should not be capitalized, as they are conceptually more similar
         to functions.

-------------------------
template GetSomeType(T) { alias T GetSomeType; }
template isSomeType(T) { enum isSomeType = is(T == SomeType); }
-------------------------
     )

    $(DT Functions)
    $(DD Function names should be camelCased, so their first letter is lowercase.
         This includes properties and member functions.

-------------------------------
int done();
int doneProcessing();
-------------------------------
    )

    $(DT Constants)
    $(DD The names of constants should be camelCased just like normal variables.

-------------------------------
enum secondsPerMinute = 60;
immutable hexDigits = "0123456789ABCDEF";
-------------------------------
    )

    $(DT Enum members)
    $(DD The members of enums should be camelCased, so their first letter is
         lowercase.

-------------------------------
Enum Direction { bwd, fwd, both }
Enum OpenRight { no, yes }
-------------------------------
    )

$(V1
    $(DT Const names)
    $(DD Are in all caps.)
)
)

<h3>Meaningless Type Aliases</h3>

    $(P Things like:)

-------------------------------
alias void VOID;
alias int INT;
alias int* pint;
-------------------------------

    $(P should be avoided.)

<h3>Declaration Style</h3>

    $(P Since the declarations are left-associative, left justify them:)

-------------------------------
int[] x, y; // makes it clear that x and y are the same type
int** p, q; // makes it clear that p and q are the same type
-------------------------------

    $(P to emphasize their relationship. Do not use the C style:)

-------------------------------
int []x, y; // confusing since y is also an int[]
int **p, q; // confusing since q is also an int**
-------------------------------

<h3>Operator Overloading</h3>

    $(P Operator overloading is a powerful tool to extend the basic
    types supported by the language. But being powerful, it has
    great potential for creating obfuscated code. In particular,
    the existing D operators have conventional meanings, such
    as $(SINGLEQUOTE +) means $(SINGLEQUOTE add) and $(SINGLEQUOTE &lt;&lt;)
    means $(SINGLEQUOTE shift left).
    Overloading operator $(SINGLEQUOTE +) with a meaning different from $(SINGLEQUOTE add)
    is arbitrarily confusing and should be avoided.
    )

<h3>Hungarian Notation</h3>

    $(P Using hungarian notation to denote the type of a variable
    is a bad idea.
    However, using notation to denote the purpose of a variable
    (that cannot be expressed by its type) is often a good
    practice.)

<h3>Properties</h3>

    $(P Functions should be property functions whenever appropriate. In
        particular, getters and setters should generally be avoided in favor of
        property functions. And in general, whereas functions should be verbs,
        properties should be nouns, just like if they were member variables.
        Getter properties should $(I not) alter state.)

<h3>Documentation</h3>

$(P
    All public declarations will be documented in
    $(LINK2 ddoc.html, Ddoc) format.
)

<h3>Unit Tests</h3>

$(P
    As much as practical, all functions will be exercised
    by unit tests using unittest blocks immediately following
    the function to be tested.
    Every path of code should be executed at least once,
    verified by the $(LINK2 code_coverage.html, code coverage analyzer).
)

<h2>Additional Requirements for Phobos</h2>

$(P
    In general, this guide does not try to recommend or require that code
    conform to any particular formatting guidelines. The small section on
    whitespace at the top contains its only formatting guidelines. However, for
    Phobos and other official D source code, there are two additional
    requirements:
 )

$(UL
    $(LI Braces should be on their own line. There are a few exceptions to this
         (such as when declaring lambda functions), but with any normal function
         block or type definition, the braces should be on their own line.)

-------------------------------
void func(int param)
{
    if(param < 0)
    {
        ...
    }
    else
    {
        ...
    }
}
-------------------------------

    $(LI Lines have a soft limit of 80 characters and a hard limit of 120
         characters. This means that most lines of code should be no longer than
         80 characters long but that they $(I can) exceed 80 characters when
         appropriate. However, they can $(I never) exceed 120 characters.)
 )

$(P
    We are not necessarily recommending that all code follow these two rules.
    They're both likely to be controversial in any discussion on coding
    standards. However, they are required in submissions to Phobos and other
    official D source code.
