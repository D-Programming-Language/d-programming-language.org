$(P The D Languages Foundation awards $(LINK2 http://dlang.org/blog/2016/12/05/the-d-language-foundations-scholarship-program, scholarships) to highly skilled students.
Each $(DOLLAR)5 you donate contributes to approximately one hour of work by a talented graduate student, and
these hours add quickly toward important projects that further the state of the art in the D
programming language.)

$(P If you have a specific target or project that you wish to directly support, please $(LINK2 mailto:foundation@dlang.org, contact the D Language Foundation).)

$(P By the Foundation bylaws, its officers (Walter Bright, Andrei Alexandrescu and Ali Ã‡ehreli)
    cannot get income from the Foundation, which preempts a variety of conflicts of interest.)

The D Language Foundation is a $(HTTPS en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization, 501(c) non-profit public charity) registered in the state of Washington, USA.
