$(D_S $(TITLE),

$(P Development of the D programming language is driven by the passion and dedication of its users. From
$(LINK2 contributors.html, submitting and reviewing pull requests) to
$(WEB issues.dlang.org, reporting issues), offering help in $(HTTPS forum.dlang.org, the forums),
and writing guest posts for $(HTTPS dlang.org/blog, the official blog), the members of the D
community contribute as and how they can, most often for no compensation other than personal
satisfaction.
)

$(P Behind the scenes, the D Language Foundation sets priority tasks, works with partners to organize
$(WEB dconf.org, the annual DConf), awards scholarships, promotes the language, and more. Here, again,
members of the community keep the wheels rolling through their generous contributions.
)

$(P On this page, we recognize some of those who have made monetary donations to the D Language Foundation.
Each $(LINK2 $(ROOT_DIR)foundation/donate.html, donation), big and small, enables us to keep working toward our goals. The
list is ordered by total donation amount, descending, and is far from exhaustive. If you have donated to
the D Language Foundation and want to see your name in the list, please let us know at
$(LINK2 mailto:social@dlang.org, social@dlang.org).
