$(D_S $(TITLE),

$(P Development of the D programming language is driven by the passion and dedication of its users. From
$(LINK2 contributors.html, submitting and reviewing pull requests) to
$(WEB issues.dlang.org, reporting issues), offering help in $(HTTPS forum.dlang.org, the forums),
and writing guest posts for $(HTTPS dlang.org/blog, the official blog), the members of the D
community contribute as and how they can, most often for no compensation other than personal
satisfaction.
)

$(P Behind the scenes, the D Language Foundation sets priority tasks, works with partners to organize
$(WEB dconf.org, the annual DConf), awards scholarships, promotes the language, and more. Here, again,
members of the community keep the wheels rolling through their generous contributions.
)

$(P On this page, we recognize some of those who have made monetary donations to the D Language Foundation.
Each $(LINK2 $(ROOT_DIR)foundation/donate.html, donation), big and small, enables us to keep working toward our goals.
