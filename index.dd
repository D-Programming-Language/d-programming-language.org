$(P The K&amp;R of D  is here! Get $(AMAZONLINK 0321635361, The D
Programming  Language) by Andrei  Alexandrescu&mdash;the authoritative
source on everything D. From the book's introduction:

$(BLOCKQUOTE $(AMAZONLINK 0321635361, The D Programming Language) by
Andrei Alexandrescu, D is a language that attempts to consistently do
the right thing within the constraints it chose: system-level access
to computing resources, high performance, and syntactic similarity
with C-derived languages.  In trying to do the right thing, D
sometimes stays with tradition and does what other languages do, and
other times it breaks tradition with a fresh, innovative solution.  On
occasion that meant revisiting the very constraints that D ostensibly
embraced.  For example, large program fragments or indeed entire
programs can be written in a well-defined memory-safe subset of D,
which entails giving away a small amount of system-level access for a
large gain in program debuggability.))

$(P  D  is  a  multi-paradigm  programming language  that  combines  a
principled approach  with a  focus on practicality.   In D you  get to
harness  the power  and high  performance of  C and  C++ and  also the
safety and  programmer productivity of  modern languages such  as Ruby
and  Python.  Special  attention  is  given to  the  needs of  quality
assurance, documentation, portability, and reliability.)

$(P The D language is statically typed and compiles directly to machine code.
It&rsquo;s multiparadigm, supporting many programming styles:
imperative, object oriented, and metaprogramming. It&rsquo;s a member of the C
syntax family, and its appearance is very similar to that of C++.
Here&rsquo;s a quick list of $(LINK2 comparison.html, features).

$(P This site does not refer to the first edition of the language,
known as "D version 1" or "D1". Currently, D1 is in maintenance mode
and has documentation available $(LINK2
http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/index.html,here). We recommend the
current edition of the D programming language (formerly known as "D2")
for new projects. )
